cluster is collection of of virtual machines. in cluster there is driver node which 
arrange the task for worker nodes
cluster form a group of computer into single computer via driver 

data bricks runs different work loads such as etl , ml

types of cluster-

1)all purpose cluster - 
created manually via graphical user interface, cli or api, [ersistnt,suitable for interactive workloads , shared among users and expensive to run
2)job cluster are created hwne a job starts to exceute, terminated at the end of job, suitable for automated workload, isolated and cheaper to run

multinode has one driver node , when job is run then driver node gives tasks to eorker node
and scales horizontally

single node have one node driver node , when spark jobs is run they acts as both driver and worker loads.

sql workforce faster.-vectorised query

memory(ml ), compute(sql, data scrience), storage(hogh disk requirement) , general, gpu (deep learning)


 pricing in volves following things-

workload, photon , pricing plan etc

dbu * price=dbu cost
1 driver * price of vm = driver node cost
no of workers * price vm= worker cost
summation of 3 gives pricing for databricks cost

cluster pool ready idle instances and max instance 2(vm)

policy are set of rule and restrict access for user so that they cant able to change

limit access.

%md -document

sas token is used to acces the storage account

session scoped authentication
cluster scoped authentication
aad pass through authentication- looks for user role , otherwise not
unity  calalog- addminister define access 

asld(gen2)

each storage acoount comes with 2keys
gives full access to the storage account


keys can be regenrated
in order to transfer data to storgae to azure data lake gen 2 we need acces keys.

sas restrict access to speicific resiurce
limit accces to specific ip address

databricks is a cloud based process which is helped to process large amount of data

azure is a service provider which provides services and manage .
dbu is databricks framework which handle calculation pricing.

advatanges of databricks -
1)cluster can reduce the cost and increses 80 % .
2)databricks can be used to made extensive data pipelines which increases procductivity.
