machine learning provides stats tools to analyze , visualise , forecasting the data.
deep learning is a subset of machine learning.(mimics the human brain.)
deep learning use multi layer neural network.

types of ml 
1) supervised ml technique-dependent or op feature,continuous(regression),categorial(classification)
classification
2)unsupervised ml- we do not know output feature, we need to find similiar cluster grop
salary   spending score[1-10]
20000     9
45000     2                     
here we create cluster
in form of graph

Algorithm 
supervised ml            unsupervised ml
1)linear regression          1) K means
2)ridge and lasso            2) Hierarichal mean
3)elastic net                 3) db scan mean
4)logistic regression
5)decision tree
6)random forest
7)ada boost
8) xg boost

Reinforcement learning- application learn by itself  by getting amazing marks .ie 
like a baby how he/she starts walking.
equation of straight line y=mx+c

wtx=0
where coordinates of w(0,0) passes through a plane.

distance of a point from a plane
d=wts/|w|
wts=wtscoso
above the plane <90

ml learns data through

1) instance based
dependent on data we will get specific o/p, see surrounding daa dependts upon where maximum data is passed of failed and given result based on maximum data

no model to store

no new prediction

2)model based technique
tries to understand pattern with data and creates generalization method to specify data


store the data in file(serialized format)

down the plane 90>

predict the new data

memorizing - instance based learning
generalizing - model based learning
