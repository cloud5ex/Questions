learn the basics- type casting,exception,function , builtin function , list , tuples , sets , dictionaries

type casting-
3 types-
  int(),float(),str()
  x=int(3)
y=float(3.4)
z=str(56)

exception-arithmetic error, assertion error, exception,indentation error, loookuperror
memoryerror
a=[1,2,4]
try:
  print()
  except:
  print()

raise statement- allows the programmer to force a specific exception to occur.

try:
  raise Nameerror("hi there")
except Nameerror:
print("an exception")

list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.Allows a duplicate member
a=[1,5,6,7,"gbg","rgb]
   tuple- is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable .allows duplicate members.

   x={3,4,5,6}

   set- is unordered and unchangebale and no duplicate memebers

   myset={"apple","banaban","cherry"}

   dictionaries- ordered and changeable and no duplicate memebers.
   thisdict={
   "brand":"ford"
   "year":56
   "name":"sarth"

data structures and algorithgm
1)arrays and linked list
2)hash tables
3)heaps, stacks and queues
4)binary search tree
5)recursion
6)sorting algorithm
